# DotDocs *(.Docs)*

DotDocs is an intuitive & reliable documentation generator library for C# projects. Currently it produces markdown files for documentation and support for website generation is planned.

> DotDocs caters to C# and has no plans to expand to other languages. In my opinion, C#/.NET community doesn't have a intuitive documentation generator. Therefore, I am building this solution for the community, enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

## Installation Guide

> **Makes sure you have the .NET 6.0 runtime installed on your machine for DotDocs to work.**

### Through Chocolately *(recommended)*

Download DotDocs through chocolately using the command below:

```sh
# Administrator Rights Required

```
