# Charp

The most intuitive & reliable documentation generator library for C# projects.

> Charp caters to C# and has no plans to expand to other languages. The C#/.NET community doesn't have a intuitive & reliable documentation generator, therefore I've dedicated many weekends of my summer building this solution ðŸ˜Š enjoy!

## Installation Guide

> **Makes sure you have the .NET 6.0 runtime installed on your machine for Charp to work.**

### Through Chocolately *(recommended)*

Download Charp through chocolately using the command below:

```sh
# Administrator Elevation Required
choco install charp --pre 
```

### Directly From Github

Download and unzip the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Chase-William/Charp/releases/).

Then configure your environment variables for *charp.exe* and you're set.

## Usage Options

### Use `.csproj`

```sh
# Must be ran from a dir with a .csproj
# Puts output inside current dir within a default "docs" folder
charp
```
```sh
# Provide a path to where a .csproj is (uses the first one found if multiple exist)
# Provide a location for docs to be put
charp "<path-to-csproj>" -o "<output-path>"
```

```sh
# Provide a path to a specific .csproj
# Provide a location for docs to be put
charp "<path>.csproj" -o "<output-path>"
```

```sh
# Provide a path to where a .csproj is (uses the first one found if multiple exist)
# Provide a location for docs to be put
# Provide a configuration file
charp "<path>" -o "<output-path>" -c "<config-file>.json"
```

> In above mentioned approaches, if your `.csproj` doesn't have `xml` comment generation enabled; it will add the flag to your `.csproj` file. Shortly followed by attempting to build your project.

### Use `.dll` & `.xml`

```bash
# Provide a path to a .dll to be used
# Provide a path to a .xml file to be used
# Provide a location for docs to be put
# Provide a configuration file
charp -dll "<path>.dll" -xml "<path>.xml" -o "<output-path>" -c "<config-file>.json"
```
