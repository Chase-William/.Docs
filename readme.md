# DotDocs *(.Docs)*

DotDocs is an intuitive & reliable documentation generator library for C# projects. Currently it produces markdown files as documentation and support for website generation is planned.

> DotDocs caters to C# and has no plans to expand to other languages. I am not satisfied with the current documentation generation tools available for the C#/.NET community. Therefore, I am building my own for the community, so enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

**Checkout my blog post where I describe the future plans for .Docs [here](https://www.chase-william.com/blogs/dotdocs).**

Take your C# project and create configurable markdown documentation!
