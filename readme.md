# Charp

The most intuitive & reliable documentation generator library for C# projects.

> Charp only caters to C# and has no plans to expand to other languages. Reason being, targeting additional languages can cause already supported languages user experience to degrade due to efforts being devoted elsewhere. I, Chase William personally am not satified with the documentation generator solutions for C#, therefore I made my own ðŸ˜€. Enjoy!

### Unit Testing

Needs to be remodeled as the system I devised for `Charp.Core` testing works better.

### To be Implemented after Initial Release

- Interfaces lack interface implementation info.
- Classes lack inheritance info.
- Classes lack interface implementation info.
- Structs lack interface implementation info.
- Need better use of hyper-links for connecting custom type info.
